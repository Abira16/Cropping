## Summary

This research project is about comparative analysis of latest border noise removal models.
- Edge detection
- YOLOV3
- U2-NET are latest models used to plain document image border noise removals. 
Our domain contains document images with reflective surfaces and clumsy backgrounds. So We analyse the models and found out best model to our domain.

## Description

<br> We compared the latest and more advanced deep learning techniques and algorithms for object detection and extraction. Without object detection, it would be impossible to remove border noises from document images which are taken by using smartphones. </br>
<br> In our research, we are dealing with relatively small dataset of reflective surface document images (NIC) with clumsy border noises which are taken using mobile phones. </br>
<br> NIC images is highly sensitive. Collect the large dataset of NIC could not easy because of privacy and security reasons. Our experiment was done to small size dataset of NIC domain. So, in our experiment, we used pre-trained models and tested with our domain. </br>
<br> Edge detection, Region based, Frame based, corner-based detection methods are not detect wanted regions to our domain because of the reflective surface images textual, non-textual clumsy background. </br>
<br> Our experiment shows that the performances between the YOLOv3 and U2-net salient model. U2-net salient object detection model removes the border noise more accurately and efficiently (~ 9.8% greater than YOLOv3) in document images. </br>
